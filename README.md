# DungeonDelver

Dungeon Delver is a randomly-generated dungeon crawling game. The objective is to 
get as far as possible before perishing. 

Each level will have a random number of enemies.In order to progress to the next
level, the player must defeat all of the enemies in the current level. This unlocks
the staircase to the next level

On any given level there is a chance a chest will spawn. Interacting with this chest
gives the player an option for a permanent stat increase to aid their run.

Controls:
WASD movement
Left-click to attack (sword arcs around the pointer)
E to interact
Esc to pause
